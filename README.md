# Teesside-University-Student-Futures-Work-Placement-Microsite
In my first-year individual assignment at Teesside University, I undertook the development of a microsite designed to streamline the process for second-year students seeking placement opportunities. I employed Bootstrap 5 for its responsive design capabilities, ensuring the microsite was accessible and user-friendly across all devices. Adopting Agile and Scrum methodologies facilitated efficient project management, enabling iterative development, rapid feedback incorporation, and effective teamwork. This project honed my web development skills, particularly in areas of user interface design, and improved my understanding of project lifecycle models. Through this assignment, I developed a robust skill set in both technical web development and soft skills such as problem-solving, communication, and adaptability, laying a solid foundation for my future in technology.


I used Bootstrap 5 to make the Teesside University project's microsite responsive and accessible, ensuring a great user experience on any device. Agile and Scrum methodologies were adopted for flexible, iterative development and effective teamwork. My technical skills in web development, including coding and design, were significantly enhanced. The project also developed my soft skills, such as problem-solving and communication. Managing the project from start to finish, I applied strategic planning and organization, which were crucial for its success. This comprehensive approach not only achieved the project goals but also broadened my expertise in both technical and interpersonal domains, laying a strong foundation for my future in the tech industry.

My dedication and the skills acquired through this process were rewarded with an 85% grade in my first-year, first-semester module. This achievement underlines my commitment to my educational journey and my passion for technology and design.In my first-year individual assignment at Teesside University, I undertook the development of a microsite designed to streamline the process for second-year students seeking placement opportunities.
